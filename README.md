# Wavefunction-Analysis
Generated and plotted quantum wavefunctions for single particles, particels in potential wells, and currently working on spherical harmonics for the hydrogen atom.

## Abstract 
The motivation behind this project was to have a clear visualization of the real, imaginary, and squared verison of the wavefunctions. In my opinion, Griffith's did not provide many clear images of this and on paper there is no way to see them move. In this project, I aim to generate wavefunctions that oscillate in time and space. I also added potential constraints. The final part is working with the spherical harmonics of the hydrogren atom, which I find to be a little difficult.
